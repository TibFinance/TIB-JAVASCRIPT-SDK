## Overview 
Before you start Using the Sdk you'll need to know some basic concept the We Use and the Different Objects and Whats their role in the app.

### API Objects Overview

To understand how to use the API, you must understand the Different objects of the application. 

For details See the pdf [Documentation](https://tibfinance.github.io/). Or get the Pdf Verion [Here](https://github.com/TibFinance/TibPhpSdk/blob/main/Documentation/Tib%20Api%20Documentation.pdf).

## Environments

Calls to the service are done via a WEB service. There are two URLs for the service:
* Production: https://portal.tib.finance    
* Development [(Sandbox)](./Documentation/Sandbox.md) : http://sandboxportal.tib.finance

## Set Up 
` Before you using the SDK you need to set the api url up and get a session id. `

Initiat the Server Caller Class  

``` var serverCaller = new ServerCaller(); ```

Then set the api Url 

``` serverCaller.initialize(siteUrl) ```  


*the `siteUrl` can be either the Sandbox or the production Envirement (we are using the sandbox version in this code sample)*

Then Create a session

``` serverCaller.CreateSession(clientId, userName, password) ```

You will need to create a session in order for you to start making calls to the Api 

The ``` serverCaller.CreateSession(...) ``` method return an object containing the SessionId that needs to be passed with each Call.

See [Demo](./Documentation/Demo.md) for a step by step from how to Create a session to Creating a payment for a bill.

## Methods 

` after you set up the api url and created a session you can start Using the Other Methods of the Sdk `

*here you see one Example but you'll see more Examples of Using the SDK in the Calls.php File*


Ex :

``` 
    var sessionId = "";  
    var customerName = "";
    var customerExternalId = ""; 
    var language = 1; 
    var customerDescription = ""; 

    serverCaller.createCustomer(customerName, customerExternalId, language, customerDescription,serviceId);
```
*For More Methods Visit [Methods](./Documentation/methods.md)*

## Handling Response 

Each Api Call Return a response Object that Follow the same Object structure 

Ex : this is the response gotten back from the previous calls
```
{
    CustomerId : "beb13973-5f04-438d-b008-7be7fd2f3765",
    CryptedSelf=> NULL,
    IV : NULL,
    Error : array(0),
    HasError : bool(false),
    Messages : "",
    NodeAnswered : "PortalHost1"
}

```
We can have many ways to handle the response, now we will focus on how to handle errors here:
- the most important properties of the object when it comes to Error Handling are :
    * "HasError" which is a boolean that tells you either the response has an error or not 
    * "Errors" which is an array of Errors
    * "Messages" the message that somes with the Response (eeven if no error is presented).

- all the calls return a promise, so basicaly you can do something like : 
```
    serverCaller.createSession().then( function (result) {
        if(result.HasError){
            // Do Something in Case of the Response Object HasError returns True 
        }else{
            // Do something in the Case of the Response Object HasError returns false.
        }
    })
    .catch(reject);

```
- This is a real life Example of a session token refresh after the session token Expires;
```
    function ResponseHandler(responseObj)
    {
        if (responseObj.HasError) {
            if( responseObj.Messages == "Need an authenticated user to perform this action" ){
               // redirect Or Call createSession method to restart a session.
            }
        } else {
            cnosole.log(responseObj);
        }       
    }
```
this is a way to handle a response , you can choose your own way to handle the response you get. 
just keep in mind that every response contains the said properties

## General Objects and  Enumerations. 
Enum are not natively implemented in Php but since the Api uses Dot net and relies heavely on the enums it's this section on the documentation is basicaly gonna be used to define the Enums to use and the correct index for each Property you will be Using in the future.

Ex :  Address global object 
In .Net it's defined this way:
```
var address = 
{
    AddressCity: "some Desc ", // City Name 
    CountryId: CountryIdEnum.USA, // User the CountryIdEnum Enumerations Available under Tib.Api.Model.Enums
    PostalZipCode: "", // the zip Code
    ProvinceStateId: ProvinceStateIdEnum.US_Alabama, // Use the ProvinceStateIdEnum Available under Tib.Api.Model.Enums
    StreetAddress: ""
}
```
but in Javascript will be defined the following way :
```
var adress = {
    AddressCity :  "_________", 
    CountryId: 1, // CountryIdEnum.USA
    PostalZipCode: "_________", 
    ProvinceStateId: 58, // ProvinceStateIdEnum.US_Alabama
    StreetAddress: "_________"  
}
```
